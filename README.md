abstract = {Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.},

This framework allows to simulate closed feedback loops using the [RecBole](https://recbole.io) library. The repository includes multiple user choice models, an example dataset as well as evaluation and plotting utilities. Please refer to the paper for more. The data and models used in the paper are available on demand via an email to [Oleg Lesota](mailto:oleg.lesota@jku.at).

## Installation
Should you wish to use CUDA, install it separately according to your setup.

Ensure your current Python environment has all necessary packages installed:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## Folder structure

To run an experiment you need to add your initial dataset into the `experiments` folder. Each subfolder is considered
its own experiment and requires an input folder with 3 files:

```
experiments/
  <experiment name>/
    input/
      dataset.inter      # Interactions
      demographics.tsv   # User demographic information
      tracks.tsv         # Music Track information
```
### Sample Dataset:
#### demographics.tsv (no header):

| Column Order | Column name         | Description            |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1            | user_country        | Country Code of User   |
| 2            | age_at_registration | Age at registration    |
| 3            | gender              | m/f                    |
| 4            | registration_time   | Registration timestamp |

Example:

```

| 2            | track        | Name of the music track |
| 3            | user_country | Country Code of track   |

Example:

```

This script internally calls the `main.py` script `n` times as a subprocess due to memory leaks within Recbole encountered during development.

### Single simulation step
To run a single iteration of the tool use the `main.py` script. All options are detailed by the `main.py -h` command.

### Output
After finishing the full experiment, you'll be left with the following folder structure:
```
experiments/
    <experiment name>/
        datasets/
            iteration_1.inter     # input data at interation 1
            iteration_2.inter
            ...
            iteration_<n>.inter   # input data at interation n
            iteration_<n+1>.inter # final dataset with all new artificial interactions added
        input/
            dataset.inter         # Interactions, unmodified
            demographics.tsv      # User demographic information, unmodified
            tracks.tsv            # Music Track information, unmodified
        log/
            ...
        log_tensorboard/
            ...
        output/
            iteration_1_accepted_songs.tsv      # Accepted songs of iteration 1
            iteration_1_top_k.tsv               # Suggested recommendations of iteration 1
            iteration_2_accepted_songs.tsv
            iteration_2_top_k.tsv
            ...
            iteration_<n>_accepted_songs.tsv
            iteration_<n>_top_k.tsv
        params.json              # Internal file with saved simulation parameters (model, choice model, config)
```

#### Datasets
The dataset folder contains the data that was used to train Recbole in a given iteration. 
**This also means that iteration_1.inter is always identical to input/dataset.inter**.
The last file in this folder was not used for training, but instead contains the resulting dataset after the
experiment finished.

#### Output
For each iteration, there are two resulting output files

**iteration_\<n\>_top_k.tsv**: Tab-Separated Tab-Separated Values file (TSV) with the following columns (with header row) detailing the best k (default k=10) recommendations per user

| Column Order | Column name | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1            | user_id     | ID (row number, starting at 0) of user in demographics table                                  |
| 2            | track_id    | ID (row number, starting at 0) of track in tracks table                                         |
| 3            | rank        | rank of the recommendation. Best recommendation is always in rank 1, second best in rank 2, etc. |
| 4            | score       | Score given to the recommendation by Recbole                                                    |

This table records what the model trained by recbole has determined to be the best k items to recommend to each user.
Note that repeated recommendation is not allowed and such recommendations are filtered out beforehand.

**iteration_\<n\>_accepted.tsv**: Tab-Separated Tab-Separated Values file (TSV) with identical file structure as `dataset.inter` (see above).

This table records the subset of the top_k table that was selected and "consumed" by the user choice model. Its content
is appended to the dataset to be used in the next simulation step.

### Evaluation
To generate the metrics used in the research paper, set your experiment(s) in the `compute_all_metrics.py` script 
and run it as a result, 3 new files will appear in the experiment folder

#### metrics.csv
The metrics file contains the same information as `user_based_metrics`, but grouped by user country and iteration.
It is useful to compare the RecSys behaviour between different demographic groups.

### Utilities
#### merge_all_metrics.py
Edit the list of experiments in the script to obtain a merged version of all the different metric files. 
The merged metric file was used to generate the figures in the paper.

#### plots.py
Generation of various plots about a dataset. If you want to recreate the figures used in the paper displaying
multiple experiments at once, create a mock experiment folder, insert the common input data and manually copy the merged
metrics files into the experiment folder.

See `python3 plots.py -h` for more details.

#### dataset_statistics.py
Utility script used to get various dataset information.
